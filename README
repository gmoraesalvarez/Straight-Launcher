This is the README file for Straight Launcher

This program was made with Lazarus Free Pascal 0.9.30.2 and requires fpc and LCL to 
compile.

There has to be a /usr/share/applications folder.
A .applications folder at home will override it.

The first execution will be slow because the program caches the icons in high resolution.

For every change in icon theme the .apps folder at home must be cleaned manually.

That's all for now.
